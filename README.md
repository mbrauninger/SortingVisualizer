# SortingVisualizer
This is a new take on visualizing sorting algorithms, which I find to be more fluid and overall more enlightening to anyone who might use the visualizer than other visualizers I have typically found online. The program uses Canvas for fluid animations, and offers various sorting speeds for the user to choose from.

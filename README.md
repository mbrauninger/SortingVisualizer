# SortingVisualizer
This is a new take on visualizing sorting algorithms, which I find to be overall more fluid and enlightening than other visualizers I have found online. The program uses Canvas for fluid animations, and offers various sorting speeds for the user to choose from. It also color codes elements depending on what state they are in in the sorting algorithm, and posts a real-time display of what the algorithm is currently doing. This is a great tool for anyone who is trying to get a better understanding of how sorting algorithms work behind the scenes.
